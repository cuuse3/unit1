# Unit 1 Practical (LTPS)

This repository is for practice of Unit 1 practicals as part of LTPS (Laboratory Task/Practical Session).

It is designed to help students develop a clear understanding of fundamental concepts in C programming. The practical exercises included here encourage hands-on learning, problem-solving, and application of theoretical knowledge in a laboratory environment.
